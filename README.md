# DS-Portfolio

Greetings: 
Welcome to my little portfolio. As you might guess, everything at work will stay at work. For my portfolio, I'd like to introduce my skills via open source tools and datasets. Some other tools that arent open source such as Oracle SQL, JMP, or SAP BI4 would be demonstrated in video format. I strive to secure a Machine Learning Engineer one day. List of skills are presented below:

**1. Programming Languages:**
   - Python: This is my primary language from school and work. This skill is demonstrated in tandem with others.
   - R: I do my best to convert my .py code to R with condition of giving me a little more time than when I write .py
   - SQL: I have a [Youtube channel](https://youtu.be/J2TvURhnBe0?si=MZ40lkQnyiD4b3iT) sharing my Leetcode solutions

**2. Data Manipulation and Analysis Libraries:**
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - SciPy

**3. Visualization Tools:**
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly

**4. Machine Learning Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - PyTorch
  - XGBoost
